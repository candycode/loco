This is the actual _LoCO_ source code.
Since most of the code is actually wrappers for QObject types, I am not currently
planning to provide the usual _Doxygen_-generated documentation, but will
make available in the future three separate documents:

* Architecture description for _LoCO_ developers(i.e. myself)
* User guide: how to use the library in your projects
* Reference guide: documented public interface

No official version number for now: will use the current SHA hash of the git repository.
Version numbering will take place after the repository is split into separate _loco-lib_ and 
_loco-apps_ repositories.
