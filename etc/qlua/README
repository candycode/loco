QLua 0.2
=======

QLua is a binding between lua 5.1/5.2/luajit and Qt(tested with versions 4.7 & 4.8).

Features
--------
QLua features:
- add QObjects to Lua context: QObject instances are translated to Lua tables,
  and invokable methods are automatically added as functions to the table
- specify the subset of methods/method types to be added to the Lua table
- invoke QObject methods exposed as signals, slots or through the Q_INVOKABLE macro
- connect QObject signals to Lua callback functions
- connect QObject signals to QObject methods
- optionally have Lua destroy the added QObjects when tables are garbage collected

QLua *is not* a Lua wrapper for the Qt toolkit; its main use is to
expose pre-created QObjects instances to the Lua environment.
It is however fairly easy to use QLua as a Qt toolkit wrapper, you could e.g.
1) Create a QObject factory and add it to the Lua context
2) Add methods to the QObject factory to create QObject wrappers which
   expose a signal/slot interface to Lua

Not that (2) is required to access QObject/QWidget features not exposed
through slots.

Usage
-----

#include "LuaContext.h"

...
LuaContext lc;
lc.AddQObject( qobjPtr, "obj1" );
...


Build
-----

A CMake configuration file is provided to build the library and sample code.
Since however there are no pre-compilation configuration steps you can very
easily copy and paste the source code directly into any project.

Being a binding between Qt and Lua the only dependencies are a Lua and Qt 
distribution.
You should be able to build QLua on any platform that works with Qt >= 4.7 
and Lua >= 5.1.
I am personally using it on the following platforms (64bit versions only):
- Windows 7
- Mac OX X Snow Leopard
- Ubuntu Linux 11.x
With Qt 4.8 and Lua versions 5.1.4, 5.2 as well as luajit-beta9.
