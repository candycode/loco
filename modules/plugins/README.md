Various plugins loadable from _LoCO_.

Of interest:

* `sample`: an example of a minimal _LoCO_ plugin derived from `loco::Object`
* `rtaudio`: interface to [The Synthesis Toolkit](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk) and examples of how to process real-time audio data, including a full spectrum analyzer with a pure JavaScript FFT implementation.
* `osgview`: OpenSceneGraph-based viewer showing how to create a minimal HUD interface on top of an OpenGL view  and use Knockoutjs and jQuery to implement an document-view type of architecture. 
* `glview`: just the code from [Qt Quarterly](http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qq/qq26-openglcanvas.html) fixed to work with Qt 4.8 and loaded from _LoCO_

Check and possibly change the various file paths in the .js files to suit your configuration.
